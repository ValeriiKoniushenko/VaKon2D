# The Flower Game

# ‚≠ê Intro
We should survive! Plant a flower and don't be killed by a snake!
At the start we have 150$. Using this money we can plant one flower for 50$. After that we will get income for 5$ every 3 seconds. But, be carefully! After each planting a big Snake-Monster will be spawned! But you can kill it using your mouse-gun! Just click on the snake do murder it.
