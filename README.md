# VaKon2D

## ‚≠ê Intro

I have been creating a game engine using raw OpenGL and my wrappings of its. You can use it to write your own game. It's
easier than writing on raw OpenGL, and it gives more abilities than SFML.
For example, you can create a game like a Terraria, or some RPG game.
<b>Accomplishment of this engine, that all possible calculations will process your GPU.</b>
<br>
Also, you can use this engine as an OpenGL wrapper for the usual code of OpenGL. It has an MIT license, so use it
everywhere!

## üéâ Getting started
To start develop your own game you have to do the next steps:

### Step #1: let's install it

1. Download and install
   ```GIT```([download](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [how to install it](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git))
2. Download and install some compiler or ```IDE```. I.e.
   ```MSVC```([download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), [how to install VS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-170))
3. Download and install the last version of ```Cmake```([download](https://cmake.org/download/))
4. Clone
   the
   repository([how to do it](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository))
5. Open a ```CMD```(```console```/```terminal```) inside the <u>cloned
   directory</u>([how to open CMD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gUvxU7EoNE))
6. In the CMD run: ```mkdir build```
7. In the CMD run: ```cd build```
8. In the CMD run: ```cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug```. If you want to build a Release version, type ```Release```
   instead of ```Debug```. Also, if you have a custom compiler, you need to write a path to this compiler.
9. In the CMD run: ```cmake --build .```

### Step #2: writing a game

1. After a successful build (previous point), you can write your own game
2. Go to folder ```/game/```
3. There you'll find three folder: ```assets```, ```include```, ```source```
    1. What to store in the folder ```asset```: you can create your own directories to store your game data(i.e.
       textures, audio files, shaders, etc.)
    2. What to store in the folder ```include```: you can store your include files(.h/.hpp) for your own game
    3. What to store in the folder ```source```: you can store your include files(.c/.cpp/.cxx) for your own game
4. Put your sources into ```source``` directory and your headers to ```include``` directory

### Step #3: getting binaries

After previous points, you can say: "<i>How to get an ```.exe``` file of my game?</i>" - it's easy!
Let's do it:

1. [Make step #1](#step-1--lets-install-it)
2. Go to ```/build/game/```
3. Looking at your compiler, you can find in this folder(or sub-folders)```VaKon2D.exe``` file - it's your game
4. You'll need a folder ```assets``` and a file ```VaKon2D.exe``` for successful launching of a game. Just pack your
   game
   with these two items - that's all!

## üìë Game-template

Basic game template, just an example of a game, you can find in the folder ```/game/```

## üìë If you want to rewrite game-template

1. You can edit ```/game/source/main.cpp``` and remove all needed files from the directory ```/game```
2. One rule: don't forget the next rows at the start of your game:

```C++
// !!!!!! don't change an order !!!!!! -->
Logger::initLogger();
GlfwWrapper::initGlfw(3, 3);
GetWindow().create({800, 600}, "Game name");
GladWrapper::initGlad();
GetWorld().init();
// <---------------------------------------
```

## üìÑ How to generate a docs(doxygen)

1. Download and install doxygen([download](https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html))
2. Add doxygen.exe to the Environment
   Variable([how to do it](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/machine-learning/oml4r/1.5.1/oread/creating-and-modifying-environment-variables-on-windows.html#GUID-DD6F9982-60D5-48F6-8270-A27EC53807D0))
3. Open a ```CMD```(```console```/```terminal```) inside the <u>cloned
   directory</u>([how to open CMD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gUvxU7EoNE))
4. Run the next command: ```doxygen```
5. Go to ```docs/html/index.html``` - it's your doc!

## üìÉ Docs

You can find docs by engine classes in the next directory: ```/docs/html/index.html```

## üìå Code-tutorial & classes & examples:

### Init your game environment

Add the next lines to your code to init game-env:

```C++
Logger::initLogger();
GlfwWrapper::initGlfw(3, 3);
GetWindow().create({800, 600}, "Game name");
GladWrapper::initGlad();
GetWorld().init();
```

First, you should initialize the game logger. It will write some logs to /game/logs folder. The logger be used in all
places of the next code, so you should initialize it first.
After that, initialize GlfwWrapper to get the ability to work with a window, window-event. If you want, you can change
the major and minor versions. You can't create a window or initialize a GLAD without initializing GLFW.
Let's initialize your window:

```c++
GetWindow().create({800, 600}, "Game name"); 
```

You can pass your values to the window's size or window's title.
After that going forward GLAD initialization and World initialization.

PS: don't forget to connect dependencies to your ```CMakeLists.txt```
```cmake
# /game/CMakeLists.txt
target_link_libraries(
	VaKon2D PUBLIC
    ...
        Core-Wrappers
        Glad
        Logger
        Misc
        World
        glfw
    ...
)
```

---

### Write your shader

How to include it: ```#include "Shader.h"``` and don't forget to add ```Core-Wrappers``` to your CMake-game
At the first you can write simple shader, like the next:

```glsl
// ======FRAGMENT SHADER=======
#version 330 core
out vec4 FragColor;
in vec2 ioCv;
uniform sampler2D uTexture;
void main()
{
    FragColor = texture(uTexture, ioCv);
}
```

And such like next too:

```glsl
// ======VERTEX SHADER=======
#version 330 core
layout (location = 0) in vec2 aPos;
layout (location = 1) in vec2 aCv;
out vec2 ioCv;
uniform mat4 uTransform;
void main()
{
    ioCv = aCv;
    gl_Position = uTransform * vec4(aPos.x, aPos.y, 0.0, 1.0);
}
```

Afet that load them to the shader class ```Shader```.

```c++
Shader vertex("assets/shaders/main-vertex.glsl", Gl::Shader::Type::Vertex);
Shader fragment("assets/shaders/main-fragment.glsl", Gl::Shader::Type::Fragment);
```

PS: don't forget to connect ```Core-Wrappers``` to your ```CMakeLists.txt```
```cmake
# /game/CMakeLists.txt
target_link_libraries(
	VaKon2D PUBLIC
    ...
	Core-Wrappers
    ...
)
```

---

### Shader-program

Shader program will save and transfer the shader[s] to the GPU
How to include it: ```#include "CustomShaderProgram.h"``` and don't forget to add ```Core-Wrappers``` to your CMake-game
dependencies(```target_link_libraries(YouGameTarget PRIVATE Core-wrappers)```
Create the first shader-program and attach shaders to it.

```c++
CustomShaderProgram program(true);
program.attachShader(vertex);
program.attachShader(fragment);
```

To create and bind shader program we can pass ```true``` like an argument to the ```CustomShaderProgram``` constructor.
After that we are attaching shaders to the shader-program.

And now you can use your shader program. Just write

```c++
program.use();
```

PS: don't forget to connect ```Core-Wrappers``` to your ```CMakeLists.txt```
```cmake
# /game/CMakeLists.txt
target_link_libraries(
	VaKon2D PUBLIC
    ...
	Core-Wrappers
    ...
)
```

---

### Textures

To load texture we should use a class Texture(```#include "Texture.h"``` and don't forget to add ```Core-Wrappers``` to
your CMake-game dependencies(```target_link_libraries(YouGameTarget PRIVATE Core-wrappers)```))
and use class ```Image``` too(```#include "Image.h"```)

```c++
Texture texture(Gl::Texture::Target::Texture2D, true, true);
Image image("assets/textures/apple.png");
texture.setImage(image);
texture.setMagAndMinFilter(Gl::Texture::MagFilter::Linear, Gl::Texture::MinFilter::LinearMipmapLinear);
```

We want to render texture 2D, so in the Texture's constructor we should pass ```Gl::Texture::Target::Texture2D```. Also,
if you want to generate and bind a texture 'in-place', we can pass ```true``` and ```true``` like the 2nd and 3rd
argument of this class.
After that we are loading an image: ```Image image("assets/textures/apple.png")```
The class Image provides more convenient interface for loading an images and getting some data about it for you or fot
the textures.
Don't forget to set image to your texture: ```texture.setImage(image);```
If you want to set mag & min filter, you can use the next functions to do
it: ```Texture::steMinFilter``` & ```Texture::setMagFilter```

PS: don't forget to connect ```Core-Wrappers``` to your ```CMakeLists.txt```
```cmake
# /game/CMakeLists.txt
target_link_libraries(
	VaKon2D PUBLIC
    ...
	Core-Wrappers
    ...
)
```

---

### First widget

```c++
Widget rect;
rect.setTexture(texture);
rect.prepare();
```

We should create our class Rectangle and set a texture to it. After that don't forget to call
function ```Rectangle::prepare``` - to prepare all OpenGL data. This function you should call only one time.

PS: don't forget to connect ```Shapes``` to your ```CMakeLists.txt```
```cmake
# /game/CMakeLists.txt
target_link_libraries(
	VaKon2D PUBLIC
    ...
	Shapes
    ...
)
```

---

### Main Loop

```c++
while (!GetWindow().shouldClose())
{
    GetWindow().clearColor(0.2f, 0.3f, 0.3f, 1.0f);
    GetWindow().clear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

    rect.draw(program);

    GetWindow().swapBuffers();
    GetWindow().pollEvent();

    GetWorld().update();
}
```

At the start of main loop, we should work while the window is open. After that need to clear background color and clear
ColorBufferBit.

```c++
GetWindow().clearColor(0.2f, 0.3f, 0.3f, 1.0f);
GetWindow().clear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
```

Don't forget to draw your rectangle:

```c++
rect.draw(program);
```

And don't forget to process buffers and events. It needs for correct working of all window events.

```c++
GetWindow().swapBuffers();
GetWindow().pollEvent();
```

Also, we have a world data. For example, timers - it's a part of a world. You should update all this data.
So, write:

```c++
GetWorld().update();
```

PS: don't forget to connect ```Window``` & ```Core-Wrappers``` to the game's ```CMakeLists.txt```
```cmake
# /game/CMakeLists.txt
target_link_libraries(
	VaKon2D PUBLIC
    ...
	Window
	Core-Wrappers
    ...
)
```

---

### Timers

If you want work with timers you should add a target ```World``` to you ```target_link_libraries``` of a game. Example:

```cmake
# /game/CMakeLists.txt
target_link_libraries(
	VaKon2D PUBLIC
	...
	World
	...
)
```

After that include ```Timers.h``` to your code.

Now you can use timers in your code. At first, let's create new timer:

```c++
Timer timer;
```

And let's set mode Infinity and set frequency one time per second. Also, don't forget to set a callback. This lambda
will be called one time per 1000ms(1s).

```c++
timer.setFrequency(Timer::Unit(1000));
timer.setMode(Timer::Mode::Infinity);
timer.setCallback([&](){ rect.move({-0.1f, 0.f}); });
```

Therefore, move this timer to world timer manager:

```c++
GetWorld().addTimer(std::move(timer));
```

After that your timer will be invalid. But you can get timer ID from a function ```World::addTimer```. You can use this
id to delete(like an example) your timer in the future.

---

### Keyboard

If you want to work with a keyboard you can use class Keyboard. But if your target is to spy for key pressing, or you want to do something on key press better to use class [InputActions](#input-actions).
So, if you still want to use it you can check key state with two functions:
```c++
#include "Mouse.h"

while (!GetWindow().shouldClose())
{
    // ...
    if (Keyboard::isKeyPressed(Keyboard::Key::W))
        goForward();
    
    if (Keyboard::isKeyReleased(Keyboard::Key::Esc))
        goToSettings();
    // ...
}
```

PS: don't forget to connect ```Input-Devices``` to your game's ```target_link_libraries```
```cmake
# /game/CMakeLists.txt
target_link_libraries(
	VaKon2D PUBLIC
    ...
	Input-Devices
    ...
)
```

---

### Mouse

If you want to work with a mouse you can use class Mouse. But if your target is to spy for key pressing, or you want to do something on key press better to use class [InputActions](#input-actions).
So, if you still want to use it you can check key state with two functions:

```c++
#include "Mouse.h"

while (!GetWindow().shouldClose())
{
    // ...
    if (Mouse::isKeyReleased(Mouse::Key::Right))
        zoom();
    
    if (Keyboard::isKeyPressed(Keyboard::Key::Left))
        fire();
    // ...
}
```

PS: don't forget to connect ```Input-Devices``` to your game's ```target_link_libraries```
```cmake
# /game/CMakeLists.txt
target_link_libraries(
	VaKon2D PUBLIC
    ...
	Input-Devices
    ...
)
```

---

### Delegates

The best solution to program anything is to use delegates. Delegate it's like a channel on YouTube, and you are subscriber of this channel. It's a delegates. You can create a listener(delegate) and wait for some event. At this time in the engine we have 3 types of delegates:
1. ```LambdaDelegate\<F>```
2. ```LambdaMulticastDelegate\<F>```
3. ```Delegate<F,CallbackT>```

#### LambdaDelegate
You can use it to call a lambda function on some event. It can have only one subscriber.
To use it write the next code:
```c++
LambdaDelegate<void()> d;
d.subscribe([](){ std::cout << "Hello world"; });
...
d.trigger();
```

#### LambdaMulticastDelegate
Almost the same as before, but it supports more than one subscriber.
```c++
LambdaMulticastDelegate<void()> d;
d.subscribe([](){ std::cout << "Hello world1"; });
d.subscribe([](){ std::cout << "Hello world2"; });
...
d.trigger();
```

#### Delegate
Almost the same as before, but it supports only one subscriber and can work with object's functions.
```c++
Delegate<VaKon2D, void(VaKon2D::*)()> d;
d.subscribe(this, &VaKon2D::print);
...
d.trigger();
```

---

### World variables

World variables it's replacement of global variables. You can exchange these variables between objects and apply them everywhere.
At first, you can put some variable to the 'world':
```c++
GetWorldVariables().set("hello", "world");
```
or 
```c++
GetWorldVariables()["hello"] = "world";
```

Of course, you can get it back:
```c++
cout << GetWorldVariables()["hello"]; // "world"
```

And also you can clear some keys if you don't need it:
```c++
GetWorldVariables().forceClear("hello");
```

---

### Widget reflector

If you want to debug your widgets you can use widget reflector. At first, you have to activate it:
```c++
getWidgetReflector().activate();
```
After that you can click at the widget and get into ```std::cout``` needed info about your widget.

More standard way to use it, it's using by pressing F1 key.
```c++
KeyboardInputAction iaWidgetReflector("WidgetReflector", Keyboard::Key::F1);
iaWidgetReflector.setFrequency(KeyboardInputAction::TimeT(100));
iaWidgetReflector.onAction.subscribe([]() { getWidgetReflector().toggle(); });
```

---

### Input actions

Input actions its cool part of this engine. The simplest way to work with input it's using of class ```Keyboard``` and ```Mouse```, but it has no any controls, you can't set frequency of pressing, pressing mode and many others.
You can work with ```KeyboardInputAction``` to get more control over your keyboard input, and class ```MouseInputAction``` to get more control over your mouse.
At start, let's create new instance of ```KeyboardInputAction```:
```c++
KeyboardInputAction input("input", Keyboard::Key::W);
```

After that you can set frequency of pressing using the function ```setFrequency```. It uses units ```ms```(1/1000s) to control the time, so you have to wrap a time into ```KeyboardInputAction::TimeT```.
```c++
input.setFrequency(KeyboardInputAction::TimeT(100));
```

If you create an input for moving my a map, it should repeat a lot of times per second. So we have to set repeatable mode.
```c++
input.setIsRepeatable(true);
```

And in the end let's subscribe at this action!
```c++
input.onAction.subscribe([&player]() { player.moveForward(); });
```

---

### Text

Working with text is pretty easy, at first you have to load font, after that set this font into your Text and that's all!
```c++
Font font("assets/fonts/Roboto-Medium.ttf");
LineText text(font, "Hello world");
```

Also, don't forget to load a needed shaders for text:
```glsl
// ========FRAGMENT SHADER========
#version 330 core
in vec2 TexCoords;
out vec4 color;

uniform sampler2D text;
uniform vec3 textColor;

void main()
{
    vec4 sampled = vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, texture(text, TexCoords).r);
    color = vec4(textColor, 1.0) * sampled;
}
```

```glsl
// ========VERTEX SHADER========
#version 330 core
layout (location = 0) in vec2 aVertex;
layout (location = 1) in vec2 aUv;

out vec2 TexCoords;

uniform vec2 uResolution;

void main()
{
    gl_Position = vec4(aVertex / uResolution, 0.0, 1.0);
    TexCoords = aUv;
}
```
And let's create new shader program:
```c++
CustomShaderProgram textProgram("assets/shaders/text.vert", "assets/shaders/text.frag");
```

Now, you can print your text on the display:
```c++
text.draw(textProgram);
```

---

### Using OpenGL wrappers

You can connect to your game Core-Wrappers and use OpenGL wrappers. You should add a target ```Core-Wrappers``` to
you ```target_link_libraries``` of a game. Example:
OpenGL wrappers take off a chance to get a mistake while you working with OpenGL. Just use it!
For example, you can create your own VBO/VAO:

```c++
#include "Gl.h"
...
auto vbo = Gl::Vbo::generate();
auto vao = Gl::Vao::generate();
```

Others function will be available in the
class ```Gl```, ```Gl::Program```, ```Gl::Shader```, ```Gl::Vao```, ```Gl::Vbo```, ```Gl::Texture```

## üí≠ What in the future?

I want to implement more and more things to give abilities like:

- Working with network, like in UnrealEngine 4\5:
    - real-time replications
    - different types of replications
    - write my own UDP protocol for data transferring
- Improve working with lightning:
    - Give an ability to create different types of lighting: global, point
    - Working with gamma and post-processing
- Pick up all the best things from an SFML(and plugins to it) in one Engine(VaKon2D)
- Easy working with se\deserializing of game data
- Adding an ability to integrate own DLC to a game
- Supporting of all new compilers: GCC, G++, Clang, MSVC
- The engine will be cross-platform
- Shader builder for PRO users
- Add working with audio
- Working with a camera
